# Life, the universe and everything else - Playground

You will find sample projects that I made for a better understanding of some concepts.

## **What you can find here:**

### `/jupyter-notebooks` machine-learning & deep-learning section
<b>[$ github checkout machine-learning](https://github.com/LukSroczynski/playgrounds/tree/master/jupyter-notebooks/machine-learning)</b>

### `/projects` frontend and backend section

<b>[$ github checkout todolist Â»](https://github.com/LukSroczynski/playgrounds/tree/master/projects/ToDoList)</b>

## Using:

* Building with `Gradle`
* `Java/Kotlin` in `/main`
* `Spock (groovy)` in `/test`

So far best combination for me :)

* DomainDrivenDesign, DesignPatterns, Elasticsearch, MongoDB
